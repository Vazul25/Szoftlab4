Robot [id=0, slowed=1.0, oiled=false, x=0, y=0, nextx=100, nexty=0, alpha=0.0, width=40, height=40, NumGlue:3, NumOil:3]
Oil [x=0, y=0, Width=40, Height=40, lifetime:10]
Oil [x=100, y=0, Width=40, Height=40, lifetime:10]
you jumped into oil
Robot [id=0, slowed=1.0, oiled=true, x=0, y=0, nextx=100, nexty=0, alpha=0.0, width=40, height=40, NumGlue:3, NumOil:3]
nextx, nexty modified to: 100, 0
there was a collision between this: Robot [id=0, slowed=1.0, oiled=false, x=100, y=0, nextx=100, nexty=0, alpha=0.0, width=40, height=40, NumGlue:3, NumOil:3]
and this: Oil [x=100, y=0, Width=40, Height=40, lifetime:10]
